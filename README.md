## The Challenge

Behance is one of the most popular websites for front-end and art portfolios. For this code challenge, you'll be using the Behance JSON API to build out a quick front-end for a search users and profile display website. To get started, visit here: [Behance Developers](https://www.behance.net/dev).

- The first view of the app should have a search box where searches for users are executed
- When a user is chosen/found, the next view is an individual profile page for the user. The profile page should include:

      	- basic information about the user (including stats)
      	- a list of their projects with links to them (links should be exterior to your app and link directly to Behance)
      	- a list of their work experience,
      	- a preview of their followers and following lists.
